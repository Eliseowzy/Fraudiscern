## Welcome

> Welcome to Fraudiscern, an accessible and friendly real time fraud control system.

## What is fraudiscren?

### Backgrounds

- Financial fraud control is **important**.
- There are just **few** open source systems.
- Most jobs are just doing "data analysis", rather than a whole cycle of product.
- **Closeness of data** makes it rather difficult to train a model or develop a system.
- We are building a **bridge**, despite the closeness of existing systems and datasets.

### Features

- **Customizable**: `Fraudiscren` is an open platform, permits users load data set or implement machine learning model
  by themselves.
- **Accessible**: `Fraudiscren` is a user-friendly web platform, no need for much code -- UI can help non-programmer start
  fraud control smoothly.
- **Reliable**: `Fraudiscern` is implemented based on Hadoop distributed ecosystem, which can handle tens of millions of
  records in real time. Meanwhile, it also supports off-line batch data warehouse.

### Ongoing

- We have implemented a framework of `fraudiscren`.
- If you are interested in, welcome to join us together to enrich it. 😀
